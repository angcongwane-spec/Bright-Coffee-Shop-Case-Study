### Key insights for noting
- The shop sales have been consistently making higher sales over the period of 6 months, evidently sales grow as seasons approach winter
- Hell’s Kitchen generate the most revenue on Tuesdays and Fridays than all the shops
- Lower Manhattan takes the number 2 spot for revenue it generates on Mondays, but is closely followed by Astoria on the same day
- Wednesdays and Thursdays Astoria keeps their revenue higher than all the shops
- Fridays is Hell’s Kitchen day due to their high revenue they suddenly gain beating all 3 shops by a mile
- The establishment makes better sales during the week than it does on the weekends, perhaps this is caused by the customers seeing the establishment as an ideal place to fill the rush before business day begins
- Sales perform best in winter more than other seasons as products like coffee, tea, and products in the bakey are most favoured
